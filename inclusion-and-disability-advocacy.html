  <p>
    Alongside my work in advisory and innovation, I contribute actively to improving disability inclusion, carer support, and workplace equity across industry and policy.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a carer of a disabled child, I experience directly how much inclusive leadership, flexible working cultures, and clear legal rights matter. These are essential not just for families, but also for the organisations that want to retain and support them. Over the past year, I have taken part in meaningful conversations with peers, media, and policymakers about the structural gaps that remain and what it takes to close them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work has strengthened my commitment to inclusive leadership and shaped how I approach organisational culture, resilience, and retention. I see inclusion not only as a moral and cultural priority, but also as a legal and strategic imperative.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are a carer, leader, HR professional, or ally working to improve inclusion in the workplace, I would welcome a conversation.
